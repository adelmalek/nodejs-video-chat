# Video Chat

- I build a video chat app using JavaScript and NodeJS.

- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - express: provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP verb (GET, POST, SET, etc.) and URL pattern ("Route")
  - cors: middleware
  - simple-peer: Web Real-Time Communication
  - socket.io: real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers
  
- Frontend:
  - navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()
  - event listeners
